# Final-Data-Science-project
Final Data Science project from TripleTen bootcamp.

Project Description:
The telecom operator Interconnect would like to be able to forecast their churn of clients.

If it's discovered that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options.

Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.

Our task is to build a model that will predict whether a customer is going to leave the company, using the provided data, which includes the data of customers taht already left the company.
